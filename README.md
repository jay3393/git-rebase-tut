Learning how git rebase works

Initial commit for feature-3.0
- outside user makes a commit
- outside user makes another commit
- outside user makes a final commit
- after outside user makes 3 commits, i finally make some local changes
- but before i push my changes, i am going to git fetch, then git merge with the remote branch without committing locally first or stashing
- just tried to do it and i cannot merge without committing my changes or stashing them first...
- might have to just rebase...
